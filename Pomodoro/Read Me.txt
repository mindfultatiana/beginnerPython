# pomodoroTimer
I wanted to work with Tkinter so I built a super basic pomodoro timer. This is a good beginner project to practice time and datetime also. I got the bones and idea of the project from Tamoghna Das but I made some changes. 

Here is his original: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/create-a-pomodoro-using-python-tkinter

I may update mine as I go along.

## First Steps
1. Be sure you have a functional version of python downloaded. For some reason 3.12 doesn't work well with libraries for me so I used 3.9.1 to build this. Download python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Import your libraries. If they are grayed out or not working somehow you may have to use pip to download them individually.
   ~~~
   pip install tkinter
3. When executing the file make sure you know what version of python you're running. You may need to run it with python3.
