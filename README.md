# Beginner Python Projects

I wanted to do two things:
1. Display my work for 100 days of code
2. Learn as much as I can about python one project at a time

So here are a bunch of different projects that someone starting in python can do. They may become progressively more complicated as I improve. I may also go in and update some projects overtime. Mostly I just want to have fun with this and encourage myself and other people to learn.

I may build things that are based off other tutorials or projects and I will give credit and links for those in the README of each project. Happy coding!
