# Tkinter Calculator Project

This is a calculator you can build using Tkinter.
I got this from Gulsanober Saba's tutorial on https://www.simplifiedpython.net/python-calculator/
Please be sure to check out the original.

I decided to make my own version myCalculator.py where I played around with the colors and the button placement.

## First Steps

1. Be sure you have a functional version of python downloaded. For some reason 3.12 doesn't work well with libraries for me so I used 3.9.1 to build this.
   Download python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Import your libraries. If they are grayed out or not working somehow you may have to use pip to download them individually.

```
pip install tkinter
```

3. If that doesn't work install using pip3

```
pip3 install tkinter
```

4. When executing the file make sure you know what version of python you're running. You may need to run it with python3.

```
\Home\WhereMyFileIsLocated> python3 calculator.py
```

## Personal Comments

This calculator was a lot more aesthetically pleasing than I expected. I also am glad I did this project because I learned to create line breaks in the code so it's not going off into the horizontal horizon to infinity.

It's nice to learn some more stylistic choices and decide how I want things to look.

This taught me that going between a display and calculations is actually really difficult with some operations. I asked for help and some people said I might have a compiler issue when trying to add a percent button. I think the problem is how it overall is built. I'm going to need to build a full calculator underneath and then create the display shell on top instead of depending on the display to do more than extremely basic arithmetic functions.

I may come back to this project later with a solution or I may try to build a calculator in a lower language and put a tkinter display on top. Either way I'll learn a lot in the process.
