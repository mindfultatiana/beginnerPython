# Whiteboard App

This is another Tkinter project for beginners.
For the original tutorial by Juan P. Romano at FreeCodeCamp...

I liked the project concept so much I decided to make a blackboard version of it.

## First Steps

1. Be sure you have a functional version of python downloaded. For some reason 3.12 doesn't work well with libraries for me so I used 3.9.1 to build this.
   Download python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Import your libraries at the top of the python document. If they are grayed out or not working somehow you may have to use pip to download them individually in Terminal.

```
pip install tkinter
```

3. If that doesn't work install using pip3

```
pip3 install tkinter
```

4. When executing the file make sure you know what version of python you're running. You may need to run it with python3.

```
\Home\WhereMyFileIsLocated> python3 WhiteBoard.py
```

## Personal Comments

I'm starting to conceptualize what a GUI is and how it works better in my mind. I'm really enjoying these tutorials and I know eventually I'll be confident enough to struggle making my own stuff.

For now I love this tutorial. Juan spent a lot of time explaining each aspect of this project and I highly recommend you check out the link and go through the parts with him.
